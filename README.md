# yellowPagesJsonCreator

Console App -- Work in Progress...

Hit "Start"

Follow prompts:
  1. Enter search term for Yellow Pages
  2. Enter Zip Code for location.
  
Console will display first 30 results from search then ask you if you want to save results to JSON file.

If you select "Y" or "YES" (casing doesn't matter), you'll get a folder dialog to select the file or path to where you want to save.
  NOTE: There is no handling for the case when a file already exists. That will come in future updates.

If you select "N" or "NO", you'll get a prompt to press 'Enter' to end the program and the console will close.
